# Options_Sync_for_PrismLauncher
options syncker between minecraft versions in PrismLauncher

Before using you should move File to instances folder (with MC versions). Because relative links. 
This python script allows you sync your options between minecraft verions easly.
It works in terminal. And Maybe works on Windows. idk.
